# Text-Mining-Mark-Twain-Novels

This project is an analysis of Mark Twain's novels using text mining techniques in R. We aim to gain insights into Twain's writing style, identify frequent word usage, and analyze the emotional tone prevalent in his literary works.

The [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/), also known as Project Gutenberg, is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, including books, and make them freely available to the public.

**Novels downloaded -**

1. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
2. The Adventures of Tom Swayer
